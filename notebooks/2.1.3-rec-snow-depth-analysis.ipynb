    "None\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps or Proceedures in the notebook \n",
    " - Clean the CBC ecological data \n",
    " - Compare to NOAA data\n",
    " - Make some plots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where the Data will Be Saved \n",
    "n/a\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "The flattened NOAA BigQuery drops the `QFLAG` column, so we cannot drop erroneous data and also does not contain the `WT**` `element` values (which can be used alongside the `PRCP` fields to determin precipitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are more permutations of which stations to consider (ie closest in elevation amongst those in the same ecosystem), but that would be combinatorial and there were little indicators that these would have yield better results."
